Okay so basically we want to finetune and prompt our model so that it
outperforms the baseline model. I think that roughly, we could just provide
few-shot prompts and increase model-size, etc. since that should help.

We could also change the datasets. Add more data or add more informative data.
Maybe we could train not on the full tinystories but also train on the qa data?
